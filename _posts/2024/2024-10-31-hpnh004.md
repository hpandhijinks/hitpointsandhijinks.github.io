## Meta Matters

What's your approach to character creation? Do you start with mechanics or narrative?

What's your favorite way a twist or surprise has been introduced in a campaign?

Where do you find inspiration for the campaigns and stories you create?

What's the most unique or bizarre character concept you've ever played or encountered?

Can you share one of the most memorable moments you've experienced during a campaign?

Which fantasy or sci-fi world would you love to run a campaign in if licensing wasn't an issue?
